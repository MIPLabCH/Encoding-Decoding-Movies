### Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between visual stimuli from natural movies and their corresponding neural responses captured through fMRI recordings. This work aims to understand and predict brain activity patterns in response to movie watching.

### Repository Structure
This repository contains several key scripts and notebooks essential to the project:

- **run.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook structured to train and test a deep neural network on already preprocessed data. The parameters in this notebook are the ones used to obtain the best results. 
- **dataset.py**: Definition of functions for processing, storing, and loading datasets used in the project.
- **models.py**: Definition of model architectures and functions for training and testing the models.
- **visualisation.py**: Definition of functions for visualizing the results of the models.
- **imports.py**: Contains all necessary imports.
- **Project Overview.pdf**: Presentation of the project covering data preprocessing, model architectures and results.
